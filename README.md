# Nebulous Dedicated Server Installation Instructions
Instructions to install Nebulous Dedicated Server on a Linux Machine

This Repository is here to assist users in the quest to Install and Configure a Nebulous: Fleet Command Dedicated Server on a Linux Host, and get them online to the point where they can join it remotely! 

If while reading this guide you are finding it's a little hard to get through it and your head is hurting, you can also have a professional hoster run the server and manage it for you. I provide everything needed for a smooth Nebulous Dedicated Server hosting experience. Reach out to me on Discord (Switchback77) for more information!

## Prerequisites
At a minimum you will need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with modest specs to get the server installed on and configured. You can rent one from any popular cloud provider such as AWS, Vultr, OVH or many many others. Alternatively you can use a Dedicated Host, which will also work perfectly well. At a minimum you will want the following:
2 CPU Cores at or above 2Ghz
3GB of RAM (Recommend 4GB as a reasonable minimum)
20GB Hard Drive Space
