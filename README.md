If while reading this guide you are finding it's a little hard to get through it and your head is hurting, you can also have a professional hoster run the server and manage it for you. I provide everything needed for a smooth Nebulous Dedicated Server hosting experience. Reach out to me on Discord (Switchback77) for more information!
